Then use the commands described \nbelow to make calls. \nYou can also press and hold the center button on the iPhone headset (or the \nequivalent button on your Bluetooth headset) to use Voice Control.\nCall someone in contacts\nSay \u201ccall\u201d or \u201cdial\u201d then say the name of the person. \nIf the person has more than one number, specify \nwhich one you want to call.\nExamples:\n\u00c2\u00c2 Call John Appleseed\n\u00c2\u00c2 Call John Appleseed at home\n\u00c2\u00c2 Call John Appleseed, mobile\nDial a number\nSay \u201ccall\u201d or \u201cdial,\u201d then say the number.\nFor best results, speak the full name of the person you\u2019re calling. If you give only the \nfirst name, and you have more than one contact with that same name, iPhone asks \nwhich of those contacts you want to call. If there\u2019s more than one number for the \nperson you\u2019re calling, specify which number to use. If you don\u2019t specify which number, \niPhone asks you which one to use.\nWhen voice dialing a number, speak each digit separately\u2014for example, say \u201cfour one \nfive, five five five, one two one two.\u201d\nNote:\u00a0\u00a0For the \u201c800\u201d area code in the U.S., you can say \u201ceight hundred.\u201d\nPrevent voice dialing when iPhone is locked:\u00a0 In Settings, choose General > Passcode \nLock and turn Voice Dial off. Unlock iPhone to use voice dialing.\n48\nChapter 3\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202fPhone",

This lets you make calls to your home \ncountry using the numbers in your contacts and favorites, without having to add a \nprefix or your country code. International Assist works for U.S. telephone numbers only.\nWhen you make a call using International Assist, \u201cInternational Assist\u201d appears on the \niPhone screen, alternating with the \u201ccalling ...\u201d message, until your call is connected.\nNote:\u00a0\u00a0International Assist is not available in all areas.\nSet the carrier to use:\u00a0 In Settings, tap Carrier, then select the carrier you prefer. This \noption is available only when you\u2019re traveling outside your carrier\u2019s network. You can \nmake calls only on carriers that have roaming agreements with your iPhone service \nprovider. For more information, see \u201cCarrier\u201d\u00a0on page\u00a0141.\nImportant:\u00a0\u00a0Voice and data roaming charges may apply. To avoid data roaming charges, \nturn Data Roaming off.\nTurn Data Roaming on or off:\u00a0 In Settings, choose General > Network and turn Data \nRoaming on or off. Data Roaming is turned off by default.\nTurning Data Roaming off helps to avoid data roaming charges when traveling outside \nyour carrier\u2019s network by disabling data transmission over the cellular network. You \ncan still access the Internet if you have a Wi-Fi connection. If Wi-Fi network access isn\u2019t \navailable, however, you cannot:\nSend or receive email\n\u2022\t\nBrowse the Internet\n\u2022\t\nSync your contacts, calendars, or bookmarks with MobileMe or Exchange\n\u2022\t\nStream YouTube videos\n\u2022\t\nGet stock quotes\n\u2022\t\nGet map locations\n\u2022\t\nGet weather reports\n\u2022\t\nPurchase music or applications\n\u2022\t\nOther third-party applications that use data roaming may also be disabled.\nIf Data Roaming is turned off, you can still make and receive phone calls, and send and \nreceive text messages. Voice roaming charges may apply. Visual voicemail is delivered \nif there\u2019s no charge; if your carrier charges for delivery of visual voicemail when \nroaming, turning Data Roaming off prevents the delivery of visual voicemail.\nTo enable email, web browsing, and other data services, turn Data Roaming on.\n57\nChapter 3\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202fPhone",

You can choose magnetic \nnorth, or have Compass adjust the declination to show true north.\nImportant:\u00a0\u00a0The accuracy of digital compass headings may be negatively affected by \nmagnetic or other environmental interference, including interference caused by the \nclose proximity of the magnets contained in the iPhone earbuds. The digital compass \nshould only be used for basic navigation assistance and should not be solely relied on \nto determine precise locations, proximity, distance, or direction.\nThe compass needs to be calibrated the first time you use it, and may need to be \ncalibrated occasionally after that. iPhone alerts you whenever calibration is needed.\nCalibrate iPhone:\u00a0 Wave iPhone in a figure eight. You may be asked to move away \nfrom a source of interference.\n173",

VoiceOver gestures include \nusing two and three fingers to tap or flick. For best results when using two- and three-\nfinger gestures, relax and let your fingers touch the screen with some space between \nyour fingers.\nYou can use standard gestures when VoiceOver is turned on, by double-tapping and \nholding your finger on the screen. A series of tones indicates that normal gestures \nare in force. They remain in effect until you lift your finger. Then VoiceOver gestures \nresume.\nYou can use many different techniques to enter VoiceOver gestures. For example, you \ncan enter a two-finger tap using two fingers from one hand, or one finger from each \nhand. You can also use your thumbs. Try different techniques to discover which works \nbest for you.\nIf your gestures don\u2019t work, try quicker movements, especially for double-tap and \nflicking gestures. To flick, try quickly brushing the screen with your finger or fingers. \nYou can practice VoiceOver gestures in Settings: choose General > Accessibility > \nVoiceOver > Practice Gestures and tap the Practice VoiceOver Gestures button.\nHere\u2019s a summary of key VoiceOver gestures:\n184\nChapter 25\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202fAccessibility",

You can use a backup to restore these items to your iPhone \nafter a software restore or to transfer the information to another iPhone.\nBacking up iPhone or restoring from a backup is not the same as syncing content \nand other items (such as music, podcasts, ringtones, photos, videos, and applications \nthat you download via iTunes) with your iTunes library. Backups include settings, \ndownloaded applications and data, and other information that resides on iPhone. \nYou can restore these items from a backup using iTunes, but you may also have to sync \nyour iTunes library content again.\nApplications downloaded from the App Store are backed up the next time you sync \nwith iTunes. Afterwards, only application data is backed up when you sync with iTunes.\nCreating Backups\nBackups can be created in the following ways:\nOnce iPhone has been configured to sync with a particular computer, iTunes \n\u2022\t\nautomatically makes a backup of iPhone on that computer when you sync. iTunes \nwon\u2019t automatically back up an iPhone that isn\u2019t configured to sync with that \ncomputer. If you\u2019ve configured iPhone to automatically sync with iTunes on a \nspecific computer, iTunes will back up iPhone every time you connect it to that \ncomputer. Automatic syncing is turned on by default. iTunes only makes one backup \neach time you connect, even if you sync multiple times before disconnecting.\nIf you choose to update the software on iPhone, iTunes will back up iPhone \n\u2022\t\nautomatically, even if it isn\u2019t configured to sync with iTunes on that computer.\nIf you choose to restore the software on iPhone, iTunes asks if you want to back up \n\u2022\t\niPhone before restoring.\nIf you use a Bluetooth headset or car kit with iPhone and you restore settings, \nyou must pair the Bluetooth device with iPhone again to use it.\n202\nAppendix A\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202fTroubleshooting",
